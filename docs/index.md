# Show Case SQLAlchemy documentation
As seen in [README](README.md), This assessment aims at modelling the reports, users, and loans that exist in the system and their relationship to one another, using SQLAlchemy. See the index below.

The amount spent on this assessment, and more, can be seen in [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@87c944a3-0f51-4430-a9b3-a0166c995bb5/projects/bqfmzrummg?start=2017-07-20&end=2017-07-26)

1. [Quick start](docs/quickstart.md)
The repository is expected to work once it has been cloned into a local host. A virtual environment that uses Python 3.6 is related by all executable files within the project.

2. Prioritisation
The shortage of time demanded a clear prioritisation of tasks. In this project, we followed a TDD approach.

3. Discussion
How the database has been structured.
