# Show Case SQLAlchemy documentation
As seen in [README](README.md), This assessment aims at modelling the reports, users, and loans that exist in the system and their relationship to one another, using SQLAlchemy. See the index below.

1. [Quick start](docs/quickstart.md)
The repository is expected to work once it has been cloned into a local host. A virtual environment that uses Python 3.6 is related by all executable files within the project.

2. Prioritisation
The shortage of time demanded a clear prioritisation of tasks. In this project, we followed a TDD approach.

3. Discussion
How the database has been structured.
